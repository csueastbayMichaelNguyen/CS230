## Cultural Policy

### How do you want to be thought of?
Viridi Automotives wants to be thought of as a pioneering force pushing for the change and innovation that lead to a more eco friendly driving experience. We what to be the answer to the question "What can the future look like for the normal driver?"

### What are the core values of the company?
Our core values are a greener and safer life for all our customers. We strive for a car that is affordable because we believe being a part of the push for green energy should not be a luxury. Our motivations are focused on being a part of improving the driving experience with our eco friendly vehicles, and with our smart cars at a lesser price than other competitors. We want self driving components and extra safety precautions added to our cars for safer roads for every family.

### Motivation
As a company, we all share a great passion for developing and innovating bleeding-edge technologies. We believe that modern issues such as climate change can be confronted and resolved with modern solutions. Even our governments are beginning to recognize this threat such as how California's Governor Newsom has announced that the state would phase out gas cars by 2035. With the rising threat and awareness of climate change, we see an oppurtunity to be part of the solution. We understand and fear that our time for complacency is no more and we must take a proactive commitment so that our future generations can continue to enjoy the earth that we see today.

### In summary
We strive for
- Innovation
- Excellence
- Environmental Friendliness
- Wide Accessibility

## Experimentation & Priorities

Our strategy revolves around taking open-source frameworks from companies like Tesla or OSVehicle in order to quickly bootstrap ourselves in developing mass-producible zero-emission vehicles.

For creating our first prototype, we will look to OSVehicle Tabby for our hardware frame to start from. From OSVehicle Tabby, the basic chassis and hardware systems will cost us $12,000. From there, we will add the necessary components to make it a more "complete car". For testing and experimentation, we will look for potential customers to “take it for a spin,” so that we can find the balancing point between comfort and cost. We are going to experiment in finding ways to reduce the price while adding in user-friendly software. The OKR’s or metrics for us to gauge our progress will be how much the car would cost and the user-satisfaction reviews. We intend for this prototype to be a way for our group to assess how well we can push the concept of a super entry-level EV car. 

Our intial priorities will be to test out the prototypes and frameworks that we pull to see what works and what need further tuning. For example, the overal battery life and general efficiency will be our first component to go under thorough and numerous testing.
