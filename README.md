## Experimentation & Priorities

Our strategy revolves around taking open-source frameworks from companies like Tesla or OSVehicle in order to quickly bootstrap ourselves in developing mass-producible zero-emission vehicles. 

For creating our first prototype, we will look to OSVehicle Tabby for our hardware frame to start from. From OSVehicle Tabby, the basic chassis and hardware systems will cost us $12,000. From there, we want to test out and improve upon the software and UI elements. For testing and experimentation, we will look for potential customers to “take it for a spin,” so that we can find the balancing point between comfort and cost. We are going to experiment in finding ways to reduce the price while adding in user-friendly software. The OKR’s or metrics for us to gauge our progress will be how much the car would cost and the user-satisfaction reviews. We intend for this prototype to be a way for our group to assess how well we can push the concept of a super entry-level EV car. 

Our intial priorities will be to test out the prototypes and frameworks that we pull to see what works and what need further tuning. For example, the overal battery life and general efficiency will be our first component to go under thorough and numerous testing.
